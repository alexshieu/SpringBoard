Attended the below meetup.
https://www.meetup.com/SVDataVizMeetup/events/245402357/

There were 6 of us in attendance. One by one we each discussed how we use and want to use data visualization and data science. Questions
were asked of each participant in order to help the group understand their goals and experiences. The group then provided feedback about
ideas to try, models to implement and where to find resources. 

I will leave out names in this section to protect the privacy of the participants. One participant was a generalist data scientist who 
had a lot of experience in many different data science projects with a focus on the visualization and story telling aspect. That participant
had a lot of knowledge on state of the art models and how to apply then in different situations. Another was working for an e-commerce 
start-up and was using data science on web analytics focusing on topics such as how long users spent on webpages, where they came from, 
what they clicked on, how long did they dwell and what resulted in conversions. Another was taking text transcriptions from interviews 
and building a model to help identify users who have psycological warning flags. 

We discussed my use case as a manufacturing manager looking to use dashboards to better drive decision making and applying machine learning
algorithms to predict inventory  and quality issues. We  also discussed usage of machine learning to increase fundraising for
the non-profit that I am on the board for. 

Overall it was an excellent experience. I emailed everyone I met at the meet-up and will be connecting with them on Linkedin as well.
