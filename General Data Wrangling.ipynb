Please take immediate action on my behalf so I can have these items removed, deleted and permanently blocked from my credit report, so that I can get back on track to a normal life. \\n\\nRegards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        27\n",
      "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me ( please see attached ). \\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries.

      "I filed a complaint stating that the Public Record Information was inaccurate in its filing. As the term \" Dismissed '' means that it is adjudicated by the law. My case concern no form of solvency, nothing was placed under conservancy, examinership, liquidation or provisional debt reconstruction. There were no exemptions, no surrender of any kind as stated within the regulations of the BAPCPA \" Means Test ''. The credit bureaus have retrieve my information from a third party entity without my authorization, therefore holding my identity and credit under \" Consumer Lock '' for 10 years.

I would like to purchase a house, but until all of the inquires are removed I will not be approved with XXXX inquires on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         13\n",

My sensitive information including name, social security number, date of birth and address were sent to over XXXX people. Several accounts were open in my name without my knowledge or consent. This account was opened as a result of this identity theft. Later I also suffered a hack due to XXXX and XXXX. I have attached documentation of the identity theft and hack. I disputed this directly with the company and did not get a response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                9\n",

      "We have been stuck in an interest only mortgage for our personal residence with Wells Fargo for 10 years, which means we have not gained XXXX penny of equity in our home in the 10 years we have been paying our mortgage ( s ). We originally had a second mortgage that was extinguished by the National Mortgage Settlement, or Attorney Generals ( AG ) Settlement in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nAt the time we were in negotiations to settle our second mortgage with Wells Fargo ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) our home was worth about 60 % of what we paid for it in XX/XX/XXXX. We were current with our first mortgage, but because we were n't current with our second mortgage payments we were finally offered a full settlement of the second mortgage through the AG Settlement. This got us out from being underwater. However because we now had Lates and a Charge-Off on our credit report ( s ), by law ( according to every underwriter we have tried to qualify with ) we are now not eligible for refinancing, or any other kind of loan, for at least another four years after the second mortgage lien release was recorded with the county recorder 's office. \\n\\nIt is apparently a similar penalty to a bankruptcy. It should not apply in our case because we qualified for the AG Settlement. Also our income is more than what is required to refinance, or take on other loans of similar principle and we have had no other problems other than this second loan extinguishment negatively effecting our credit report ( s ). What if anything is being done to correct the problem with this law?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "My wife and I have a mortgage loan with JP Morgan Chase. We have had this mortgage for the past 10 years. In 2007, when the economy crashed, our $ XXXX home was now only worth {$170000.00} per the appraisal. We have attempted to have a loan modification twice in the past 5 years. Our modifications request were based on the monetary status the house was now worth ( UNDERWATER ) and the {$13.00} XXXX dollar settlement between the government and JP Chase. In XXXX attempts, we were denied. We requested a lower interest rate and a reduction in principle. We would like our case reviewed as JP Chase is not complying to the governments mandates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

Can you please help me resolve this issue?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
      "i have been a valuable member and have used and paid the card only to receive a XXXX increase in my limit. I think this is ridiculous and i would use the card alot more and pay it off more if the limit was increased. When i opened the account the lady told me that i could probably request a XXXX limit within about 3 months but yet i am at XXXX.

      "Nationstar has refused to release my much needed insurance claim funds that are required to repair my fire damaged property. Have spoken with countless agents in the Loss Draft Department and managers in the corporate Customer Service Department only to be given a further run around. Nationstar has held on to these funds for over a month now without releasing any funds for the remediation of my property. Had been told that the reason they ca n't release the funds to me is because the state of Virginia where I live requires a licensed contractor to do the repairs. Title XXXX in the code of Virginia allows for Homeowners to repair their properties without the need for a contractors license.

I hav e still not gotten a reply from them nor have I received any additional correspondence associated with this account they claim to be mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

      "At the time, in early 2015, I was a customer of Bank of America, living in XXXX County, Virginia. I had several unauthorized charges on my account, and as soon as I noticed them, I contacted BofA 's fraud hotline and had them begin an investigation, with some of the money temporarily returned to me. I was supposed to receive some forms in the mail, including affidavits to sign, however I never received these documents. Subsequent calls to Bank of America told me that the documents were on their way and not to worry. Then, suddenly, out of the blue, Bank of America closed my account without warning and sent a letter of explanation that said I was severely overdrawn because they had removed the temporary credits because I had not turned in those signed affidavits that I had never received. Now I have a permanent black mark on my credit report and am blocked from re-opening my account at Bank of America. Since this was n't my fault and I made several reasonable attempts to resolve the situation by following through on their legal requests of me, I would like this decision to be reversed and to be allowed to bank with Bank of America again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

      "I am writing this complaint on behalf of my promissory note along with all the paperwork or documents signed at closing here and a state of South Carolina. Going over the documents of a new loan modification I noticed that something was wrong on the documents so that let me to start doing research on these documents in every kind of sources, links and informations. One of the major things that I found out that state laws of South Carolina, is that when you are doing a closing to buy a home or loan modification there shall be present an notary and attorney that 's going to represent both parties and also XXXX witnesses, I definitely understand that this never happened. I understand that I was not given a full disclosure and that the bank fail to do so. I have the original documents that I signed with the notary. The notary sign my copies same as the ones that are or were going to be presented to the bank. Keep in mind there was never an attorney present nor witnesses, except for the one I had present. The conclusion of the closing when all paperwork and documents were signed I signed my wife sign and my mother in law was my witness and the notary signed as a witness as well and then notarized the documents. From that moment I noticed that something was not right. After the 10th day the bank send copies of the closing documents which I noticed that my original copies did not match the banks copies when it came about the witnesses, notary and the signatures. With all the research that I have been doing with TILA, RESPA, Full Faith and credit, Fair debt collection act, XXXX XXXX, USDA IRS and now CFPD gathering all this information makes me understand that the bank has committed fraud and deceptive practices, along with fabricating fake documents, fake notaries, fake witnesses, robo signature, due to an unlawful, illegal, fraudulent, discrimination, and misleading by the bank I demand under the full faith and credit section XXXX that all conventional or individual loan guarantee are back by 90 %.

His XXXX payment was {$1100.00} and his XXXX bill was {$1100.00}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
